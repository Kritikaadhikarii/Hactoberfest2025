MemoRift — Good Memory Game

Hello Players,
It is a fun game where you flip cards and try to find the ones that look the same.

It’s easy to play and looks really nice too. The goal is simple — find all the matching cards using the smallest number of moves you can.

How to Play:

1. Click any card to flip it and see the picture hiding under it.

2. Then click another card to find the same picture.

3. If both cards are the same, they stay open.

4. If they are different, they will flip back. Try to remember where they were.

5. Keep flipping and matching until all the cards are open and you win the game.

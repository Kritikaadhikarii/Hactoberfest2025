I remember stumbling upon a beautifully designed website one day and thinking, "How do people even make something like this?" At the time, I had no technical background—just a creative itch and a desire to build something of my own on the internet. That tiny question sparked something, and I began digging deeper.

My first step was watching beginner tutorials on YouTube—shoutout to creators like BroCode and Kevin Powell who made things so easy to understand. I started with the basics: HTML for structure, CSS for style, and eventually JavaScript for interactivity. Writing my first lines of code felt magical. I’d type something, hit refresh, and instantly see my work on screen. It was like painting, but with logic.

At first, I built small projects—a personal webpage, a to-do list app, a basic portfolio. Each one taught me something new. I made tons of mistakes (and still do), but every bug I fixed felt like solving a mini puzzle. The sense of progress kept me going.

Over time, I began understanding how websites actually work—from responsiveness and layout to user experience. I also realized web development isn’t just about code; it’s about problem-solving, design thinking, and continuous learning.

This blog is where I share that journey—what I learn, what I build, and where I stumble (and get back up). I’m still growing, still building, and honestly, still just getting started. If you're new to this world, trust me—it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Start small, stay consistent, and enjoy the process. You’ll be surprised how far a single line of code can take you.</p>
